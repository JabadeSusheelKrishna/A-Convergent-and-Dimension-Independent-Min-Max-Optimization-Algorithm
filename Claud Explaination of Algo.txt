Sure, let's consider a simple quadratic loss function:

f(x, y) = (x - y)^2

We'll initialize the algorithm with x_0 = 1.0 and y_0 = 3.0.

Let's also assume the following parameters:
η (learning rate) = 0.1
τ (temperature) = 0.5
r_max (maximum rejections) = 10
c (annealing factor) = 1.0

And for simplicity, let's assume that the distribution Q_{x,y} always returns a constant vector Δ = [0.5, 0.5].

Iteration 0:
- f_old = (1.0 - 3.0)^2 = 4.0
- Δ_0 = [0.5, 0.5] (sampled from Q_{x,y})
- X_{1} = x_0 + Δ_0 = 1.0 + [0.5, 0.5] = [1.5, 1.5]
- Run Algorithm 2 with inputs X_{1} = [1.5, 1.5] and y_0 = 3.0, let's assume it returns y_1 = 2.0
- f_new = (1.5 - 2.0)^2 = 0.25
- Accept probability = max(0, 1 - e^(-(4.0 - 0.25) / 0.5)) = 1.0
- Since the probability is 1.0, we accept the updates
- x_1 = X_{1} = [1.5, 1.5], y_1 = 2.0, f_old = 0.25

Iteration 1:
- Δ_1 = [0.5, 0.5] (sampled from Q_{x,y})
- X_{2} = x_1 + Δ_1 = [1.5, 1.5] + [0.5, 0.5] = [2.0, 2.0]
- Run Algorithm 2 with inputs X_{2} = [2.0, 2.0] and y_1 = 2.0, let's assume it returns y_2 = 2.5
- f_new = (2.0 - 2.5)^2 = 0.25
- Accept probability = max(0, 1 - e^(-(0.25 - 0.25) / 0.5)) = 0.5
- Let's assume we accept the updates (random decision based on the 0.5 probability)
- x_2 = X_{2} = [2.0, 2.0], y_2 = 2.5, f_old = 0.25

Iteration 2:
- Δ_2 = [0.5, 0.5] (sampled from Q_{x,y})
- X_{3} = x_2 + Δ_2 = [2.0, 2.0] + [0.5, 0.5] = [2.5, 2.5]
- Run Algorithm 2 with inputs X_{3} = [2.5, 2.5] and y_2 = 2.5, let's assume it returns y_3 = 2.5
- f_new = (2.5 - 2.5)^2 = 0.0
- Accept probability = max(0, 1 - e^(-(0.25 - 0.0) / 0.5)) = 1.0
- Since the probability is 1.0, we accept the updates
- x_3 = X_{3} = [2.5, 2.5], y_3 = 2.5, f_old = 0.0

At this point, the algorithm has converged to the optimal solution (x*, y*) = (2.5, 2.5) with a loss of 0.0.

Note that this is a simplified example, and the actual behavior of the algorithm would depend on the specific loss function, distribution Q_{x,y}, and the implementation of Algorithm 2.
